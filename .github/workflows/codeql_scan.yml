# CodeQL Code Scanning GitHub Action
# 
# This workflow enables CodeQL code scanning for your repository to identify
# security vulnerabilities and coding errors in your codebase.
#
# To use this workflow:
# 1. Copy this file to your repository's .github/workflows/ directory
# 2. The workflow will automatically run on push, pull requests, and on a schedule
# 3. Review and address any security alerts in the Security tab of your repository
#
# Note: CodeQL only analyzes these languages:
# C/C++, C#, Go, Java/Kotlin, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Ruby, Swift
# If your repository contains only configuration files (YAML, JSON, XML) or 
# documentation, this workflow will exit gracefully without errors.
#
# For more information about CodeQL, see:
# https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/about-codeql/
